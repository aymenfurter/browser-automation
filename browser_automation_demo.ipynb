    "1. Creates an agent that uses the Browser Automation tool to perform explorative testing against https://careers.microsoft.com/\n",
    "2. Runs three independent browser sessions to capture job counts for Switzerland, Germany, and France\n",
    "3. Consolidates the session output with a second agent that uses the Code Interpreter tool to generate an Excel report\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Azure AI Foundry project with configured agents\n",
    "- Browser Automation connection configured in Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "- Required environment variables in `.env` file"
